points to consider?
- notes re dependency injection vs "instance"?
- config file cleanup / devops / deploy / build server
- mention UI translation, for example status enum?
- should there be an enum for asc, desc?
- case-sensitivity for both filtering and sorting?
- should xml code comments be added? also could / would the swagger use that?
- figure out how to pre-populate the input / text box value?
- tried to split the components into separate .js files, but kept getting a runtime error with '<'
- figure out how to specify a default file, for default.html
