points to consider?
- notes re dependency injection vs "instance"?
- config file cleanup / devops / deploy / build server
- mention UI translation, for example status enum?
- should there be an enum for asc, desc?
- case-sensitivity for both filtering and sorting?
- should xml code comments be added? also could / would the swagger use that?
- figure out how to pre-populate the input / text box value?
  - bug: select sales opportunity doesn't populate / clear text input
- tried to split the components into separate .js files, but kept getting a runtime error with '<'
  - it's probably some kind of config error?
  - tried the default sample components from https://react.dev/learn/importing-and-exporting-components and they produced the same error
  - others online are having a similar problem with the same error
- figure out how to specify a default file, for default.html
- Inline Babel script:137 Warning: Each child in a list should have a unique "key" prop. Check the render method of `CustomersList
- i like using state, but not sure what best practices are / reminds me of something called observable?
- bug change for sales opportunity ids to be duplicated? unsure if already resolved
- there's no "POCO" equivalent defined on the client side
- no front-end validation
- cover backend data paging (and existing functions)?
- mention api.http for creating fresh database / similar to swagger?
- find command for how the project was started?
  - tried to use minimal templates so that i could learn more about how things connect together
- inputs missing labels?
